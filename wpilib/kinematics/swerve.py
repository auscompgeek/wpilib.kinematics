    respect to the center of rotation. The center of rotation for inverse
    kinematics is also variable. This means that you can set your set your center
    of rotation in a corner of the robot to perform special evasion maneuvers.

    Forward kinematics (converting an array of module states into the overall
    chassis motion) is performs the exact opposite of what inverse kinematics
    does. Since this is an overdetermined system (more equations than variables),
    we use a least-squares approximation.

    We take the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of [moduleLocations] and then
    multiply by [moduleStates] to get our chassis speeds.
